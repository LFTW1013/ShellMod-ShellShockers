  Used with a userscript extention like TamperMonkey. You can also just paste this into the shellshock browser console! To use insert the source code into the extention by creating a new userscript and pasting/uploading the code into extention. (Varies depending on which extention you use.)

INFO:
- It should work with all browsers, but popular browsers like Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera are recomended 
- The test script is a script for testing, items that are working their way into the final "source.js" code.
- This mod pack does not violate the Shellshockers TOS, because it is only overlays and client-side modifications.
